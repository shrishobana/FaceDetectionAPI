# FaceDetectionAPI
A simple Console app (.NET Framework) that uses REST calls with the Azure Face service to detect faces in an image and return their attributes.

This is my modified code from: Quickstart: Detect faces in an image using the Face REST API and C# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/face/quickstarts/csharp

Input: jpg image (on local disk) containing a human face

Output: JSON result to console and JSON file (on local disk)
